# Vigenere-Cipher-Decoder
This project is developed using Core Java based on Vigenere Cipher algorithm for decoding. An encrypted cipher is fed in this project. The project is divided into two phases: to determine the key length and then determine the key. After the key is cracked, the encrypted cipher is then converted to the plain text that was transmitted from the sender.
